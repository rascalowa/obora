          We had a plan to travel around the world but it turned out to be
          exhausting. Instead we have decided on taking shorter trips. With this
          idea we were able to enjoy every country we have visited, that is what
          we highly recommend! Work as a instructors while traveling helped us
          to stay afloat. But you need to watch out: traveling is addictive!

        Before she met her future husband horses was all her life. As a teenager
        she spended few hours every day in a stable. Taking part in the
        competition in dressage, show jumping and eventing was what she wanted
        to do all the time. Then she met Greg and he turned her life upside
        down. She started traveling with him and she learned how to kitesurf.
        Now she has big passion for strapless kitesurfing, but one day horses
        will come back to her life.

        Sport always was present in his life from a young age. Especially he
        likes all kind of board sports. Nature enthusiast, his best way to relax
        is to feel the smell of the forest and the wind in his hair. In winter
        he loves to hit the backcountry, fresh light snow is the best for him.
        Summertime he switches his snowboard for surfboard, with or without a
        kite. Bigger wave = better day!

          idea we were able to enjoy every country we have visited, that is what
          we highly recommend! Work as a instructors while traveling helped us
          to stay afloat. Below we are presenting best places we have already
          visited. But you need to watch out: traveling is addictive!

          1.<br />On the order between Agrentina and Brazil we can find Iguazu.
          Most amazing place we have seen so far, Monika's childhood dream.
          Iguazu is a set of 275 minor waterfalls, big mass of water in falling
          down every second (1700m2). Worth every penny!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2.<br />
          Wonderful beaches in Philippines. White sand, palm trees and amazing
          underwater world! Boracay's Whitebeach with r white sand and clear
          crystal water is great before/after highseason. Siargao island offers
          great waves for surfing and beautiful landscapes both on the coast and
          inland. Filipinos are very friendly and always willing to help. The
          best destination for longer holidays.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          3.<br />
          Wild fauna and flora in CostaRica. Monkeys jumping above your head,
          huge sea turtles in the water and hunting pelicans are just small part
          of costarican wildlife. Deeper in the jungle you can find way more,
          but it is not always good idea to look for more.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          4.<br />
          Canyon Colca in Peru. One of the deepest canyons in the world (3270m -
          twice as deep as Grand Canyon in the USA). Huge space between steep
          sides is a great place for biggest flying birds in the world. Condors
          weight up to 15 kg and their wingspan could be even 320cm! Just
          imagine these enormous animals flying few meters above your head!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          5.<br />
          Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia is the world's largest salt flat (over
          10,000 square kilometers). During dry season we can see hexagonal salt
          formations on the surface. Following rain Uyuni transforms into the
          world's biggest mirror. Unforgettable view...
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          6.<br />
          Whole wietnam is a beautiful country, but what we found the most
          interesting was the limestone formations in Ha Long Bay and in Tam Coc
          province. In Ha Long Bay we can see many islands on the water while
          Tam Coc has a very similar view but islands are between rice fields.
          Both of them are great.
